        Users should always be informed about what is going on through
        appropriate and timely feedback. When people interact with any system it
        should always provide immediate feedback on the interaction. This helps
        create a smooth navigation process for users.

      <h2>Scenario</h2>
      <p>
        When you pick up your smartphone. As soon as you lift it, the screen
        lights up and it informs you of missed notifications from various apps,
        received messages, and missed calls. You can always tell how much
        battery power you have left, the status of your internet connection, how
        much cell reception you have (usually using a bar graph), and the time.{' '}

        Some other examples showing how to give feedback to users inappropriate
        time. We can do that by image, illustration, text even with sound. After
        posting on Twitter, emailing from mail application we hear a ‘swoosh’
        sound, its also a good example.

        How do feel when you see the item is not available or the size is not
        available in Cart List? Do you become angry after not getting any
        feedback by clicking ADD TO CART button? The system not giving feedback
        on the action you did.
      </p>
      <p>
        You saw the item in the products list but something went wrong now. Look
        at the above screenshots. The system keeps telling the user which size
        is available, which color is out of stock. After selecting the item you
        get a pop up ‘Your item is added to cart’, now you feel comfortable in
        using the system as you know what state are you in the system and you
        continue the shopping.
