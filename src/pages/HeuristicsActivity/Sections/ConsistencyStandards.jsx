        There are platform and industry conventions that must be followed in
        order to lesson the cognitive burden on users of deciphering every
        system they encounter. It is important that when a user is using your
        platform, they know that their expectations will be met. Important
        things to remember: 1. Maintain internal and external consistency with
        your platform in order to improve learnability. 2. Stay consistent
        within your product(s) (internal consistency). 3. Follow established
        industry conventions (external consistency)

        The example above shows two diffferent layouts for a login form. Notice
        how strange the second example looks. Thats because it is not following
        the external consistency rule of following established industry
        conventions.

      <h2>Rules For Design Standards</h2>
      <p>
        To be successful, an interface design standard must: • be
        well-illustrated with examples since designers go by the examples much
        more than body text • make sure that the examples fully comply with the
        standard in all aspects and not just the one they are intended to
        illustrate (designers may pick up more than one hint from a given
        example) • have extensive and comprehensive checklists as much as
        possible (designers prefer to scan down a list instead of having to read
        text) — for example, a list of all elements that must be on every page
        or a list of preferred terminology • have a standards expert available
        both to review new designs in a formal standards inspections and for
        more informal consultations whenever designers are in doubt about the
        correct interpretation of the standard (if there is no easy place to
        turn with questions, then each designer will make up his or her own
        answer — guaranteed to be different in each case) • be supported by an
        active evangelism program. It is not enough to wait to be consulted: you
        must actively seek out projects and visit them to tell them about the
        standard and to (gently) comment on their designs and how to correct the
        inevitable deviations • be a living document under the control of a
        standards manager who updates the standard as new issues emerge • either
        comply with the most popular other design standards or contain explicit
        statements highlighting the differences to these other standards • be
        supported by development tools and templates that make it easier to
        comply with the standard than to implement a non-standard design • have
        a good index (if printed) or a good search supplemented with hypertext
        links to related rules (if online)
