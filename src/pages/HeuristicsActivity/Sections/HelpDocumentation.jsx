        Websites and applications can offer two types of help: proactive and
        reactive. Proactive help is provided before the user has encountered a
        problem, in order to prevent issues. It includes onboarding tutorials
        and contextual tips. In contrast, reactive help includes materials such
        as documentation, videos, or even tutorials for those situations when
        users have an issue and they seek out advice to address it. (Even though
        some users may consume such materials proactively, it is rare that they
        do so.)

        Proactive Help The goal of proactive help is to familiarize users with
        an interface. Proactive help often occurs in three scenarios: New users
        at first launch of an interface Novice users as they gain proficiency
        with an interface (this happens over time and is most relevant for
        complex applications) Existing users encountering a new or redesigned
        interface Proactive help can be implemented through tutorials,
        instructional overlays, templates, contextual help, tooltips, and
        wizards.

        Push and Pull Revelations: Two Types of Proactive Help Proactive help
        comes in two forms, push revelations and pull revelations. The
        difference between these relies on whether they are individualized to
        the user’s context and likely to be related to the current user goal.
        Push revelations occur when an interface provides assistance or help
        content that isn’t relevant to the users’ goals. Aptly named, this type
        of proactive help pushes help content in a relatively random way, with
        no regard for what the user is trying to do at the moment. The classic
        example is the tips or instructional overlays that occur when an
        application is launched and that inform users of new features.

        When logging into O’Reilly, a digital library, the system pushed
        proactive help with an instructional overlay highlighting interface
        elements.
