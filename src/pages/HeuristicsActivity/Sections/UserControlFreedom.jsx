        Example: The freedom to undo any accidental actions. This principle can
        be best illustrated by the Gmail’s flash message with undo action when
        we accidentally delete an email.

      <p>
        It is very common for users to make mistakes while using a product.
        Because of this, it is important that we design ways to help them undo
        those mistakes. Imagine a situation that involves something like an
        accidental deletion of an important file or posting a grammatical
        mistake on your company’s social media; every system should have a
        clearly marked “emergency exit” mechanism, that provides users with an
        easy way to get back after they find themselves in an unwanted state.
      </p>
      {/* Make sure to have alt tag for image. */}
      <img src="" alt="" />
      {/* Make sure to have alt tag for image. */}
      <img src="" alt="" />
      {/* Make sure to have alt tag for image. */}
      <img src="" alt="" />
      <p>
        The examples above are some of the UI elements that can help users go
        back to the previous state the system was in. They are another way of
        giving the user control.
      </p>
      {/* Make sure to have alt tag for image. */}
      <img src="" alt="" />
      <p>
        Another Example of User Control: Gmail Gmail gives users the ability to
        recover from accidently deleting an email. They can undo the action of
        deleting an email by finding the email in the “Trash” folder and moving
        the email back into their “Inbox.” This allows them to recover from
        their mistake.
