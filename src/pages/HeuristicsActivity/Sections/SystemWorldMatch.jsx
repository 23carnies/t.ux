        By using language that is familiar to your user, you create an
        environment for users that is easier to navigate, understand, and
        remember how to use. It is important that the language, mental models,
        and concepts you choose to implement are familiar to your users. It is
        important to: 1. Research your user, the wording they use, and design
        with that in mind 2. Choose clear and concise wording that is easy to
        understand 3. If you need to use a word not everyone understands,
        provide a definition to go with it. They should never have to leave the
        site to look up a word. 4. Leverage familiarity with real-world objects
        and activities - design in a way that reflects material objects people
        already use.

        “In simple terms, the system must speak the user's language which were
        familiar to them, rather than system oriented jargons. We always seek
        familiar words, things, concepts, shapes, images to understand and to
        make a decision.” - Harsh Gorasia uxPlanet.org{' '}

        Most of the times the users are going to search for you on the internet
        or are going to navigate within your website using language that seems
        more natural to them.

        The 7th usability heuristic (flexibility and efficiency of use) is about
        allowing users to approach tasks in a variety of ways. New users may
        require guidance in performing their tasks, whereas experienced users
        can take advantage of accelerators and other secondary features designed
        to speed up commonly performed actions. Embracing this heuristic means
        allowing user customization, not being prescriptive about core task
        steps, and adding unobtrusive accelerators that power users can discover
        and employ efficiently.{' '}
