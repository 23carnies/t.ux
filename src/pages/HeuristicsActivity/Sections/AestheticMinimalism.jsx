        <strong>Example:</strong> An ornate teapot may have excessive decorative
        elements that can interfere with usability, like an uncomfortable handle
        or hard to wash nozzle.

        Interfaces should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely
        needed. Every extra unit of information in an interface competes with
        the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative
        visibility. This heuristic doesn't mean you have to use a flat design —
        it's about making sure you're keeping the content and visual design
        focused on the essentials. Ensure that the visual elements of the
        interface support the user's primary goals.

      <h2>Ways to ensure Aesthetic and minimalist design</h2>
      <h3>1. Show only relevant things</h3>
      <p>
        Medium – the blogging platform is a great example of this heuristic. It
        is essentially like a blank piece of paper and if you need to add
        anything beyond text, you just need to click on the + sign which again
        is the universal sign for adding something.

      <h3>2. Maintain hierarchy</h3>
      <p>
        If you have created something that needs a lot of content, think of ways
        to organize it in proper hierarchy and sections. This is an important
        concept of aesthetic and minimalist design. The websites like Atlassian
        and Stripe are the perfect examples. They have a lot of aesthetically
        placed content.
